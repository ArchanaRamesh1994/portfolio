        I worked for a start up called Pearit, based in Los Angeles over the summer and my role was
that of a UX Design Intern.<br>
They had basic website setup and they wanted me to redesign some of their pages.
The pages that I redesigned were:<br>
        <ul><li>The Home page</li>
        <li>The premium account page</li>
            <li>The cancellation page</li>
            <li>Student/Employee Account page</li>
            <li>Employer Account Page</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <div class="divi">
            <div class="txttd left-float">
            Target Audience: Students, potential Employees, Employers
Methodology:
I first looked at the design of the current pages and performed heuristic evaluations to
look at the problems and the usability issues in the website.
I came up with the heuristic reports and gave it to my manager.
Based on the usability issues, I started to think of the changes that I had to make in the
website. I also changed some of the aesthetics wrt the websites. The premium account
page, and the cancellation page was completely built by me.

page, and the cancellation page was completely built by me.
Process:
The first page that I started to design from scratch was the premium account page an
the cancellation page.
For the premium account page, I first looked at all the elements that had to go into the
page and started building a wireframe using balsamic. Once this wireframe was
approved by my manager, I started to build the prototype using Photoshop and mock
plus.
I designed some of the elements on the page and also added all the content onto the
page.
For the Student/ employee, employer account pages, and the home page, I completely
redesigned the pages after doing a heuristic evaluation.
I first made wireframes, ost which I made the prototypes.

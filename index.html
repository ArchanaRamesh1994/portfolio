	<div id="aboutMe">I am currently a graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology studying Human Computer Interaction. The fascination for designing interfaces and improving user experience led me to pick Human Computer Interaction as my major for my Masters. I am very enthusiastic about designing and building interfaces and aspire on becoming a UX designer. Web design and development are my key areas of interest.
My younger days at school focussed on personality development which led me to participate in many activities such as swimming, singing and dance. I have won many medals in swimming at the district level and also am accomplished in Indian classical music.
During my bachelors, I participated in many voluntary activities, the most noteworthy being organizing blood donation camps.</div>

Heuristic evaluations were done post which screeners and flyers were printed, participants were recruited and a test plan was created. Usability testing was performed by creating tasks and asking participants to perform them and finally the results were interpreted.</p>

We all first performed heuristic evaluations individually to identify the usability and accessibility
issues in the website. Once this was done, we all sat and discussed each of our heuristic evaluations and came up
with a document which was a compilation of all of the problems we found with the website. A
total of 27 usability and accessibility issues was found with the website.</p>

successful the student was in fulfiling that course outcome. 
This also helped in updating the courses in future. Backend: MySQL

                            I worked for a start up called Pearit, based in Los Angeles over the summer and my role was that of a UX Design Intern.

                            <p>Methodology:</p>
I first looked at the design of the current pages and performed heuristic evaluations to look at the problems and the usability issues in the website.
I came up with the heuristic reports and gave it to my manager. 
Based on the usability issues, I started to think of the changes that I had to make in the website. I also changed some of the aesthetics wrt the websites. The premium account page, and the cancellation page was completely built by me.

                            <p>Process:</p>
The first page that I started to design from scratch was the premium account page and the cancellation page.
For the premium account page, I first looked at all the elements that had to go into the page and started building a wireframe using balsamiq. Once this wireframe was approved by my manager, I started to build the prototype using Photoshop and mock plus.
I designed some of the elements on the page and also added all the content onto the page.
For the Student/ employee, employer account pages, and the home page, I completely redesigned the pages after doing a heuristic evaluation. 
I first made wireframes, post which I made the prototypes.

                            <p>Introduction:</p>
The present day visual inspection of the aircraft is purely skill based, is time
consuming, raises safety issues to the inspector, and there is also lack of record of the inspection.
The accuracy can be affected by inspector boredom, weather conditions and weariness. Images captured from the aircraft surface and presented to the inspector after enhancing the defects can make the visual inspection easier and accurate which in turn results in saving time, and ensures the safety of aircraft.

                            <p>Problem Statement:</p>
Development and implementation of algorithms for the detection of surface
defect (dents) in aircraft surfaces using image processing. It involves image
acquisition, noise removal, background removal, phase wrapping, phase unwrapping
and height mapping.<br><br>

<p>Objectives:</p>
The project aims to create a semi-automated system to perform dent detection
on the surface of aircraft structures. The objectives include identification of dented
regions, classification of the dents from surface features such as writings, markings,
textures and patterns and quantification of the detected dent.

                            <p>Methodology:</p>
Use of 2D image processing using edge detection is not good enough for the
detection of dents as dents deform the surface into third dimension. Also the use of
edge detection will also detect the surface features like writing, markings on the
surface also as defects. This problem can be solved by trying to re-create the height
information of the surface. Variety of ways are described in literature to carry out the
profile mapping using optical profilometry. Fringe pattern based optical profilometry
method is adopted in this study using 3-step Phase Shift which involves following
steps: 1) digital fringe projection, 2) image acquisition, 3) image processing, 4) fringe
analysis, that includes phase detection and phase unwrapping, and 5) height mapping.
Digital Fringe Projection involves projecting a fringe pattern onto the object
surface. A sinusoidal fringe pattern is used as it has features that counter defocussing
and is most apt to be processed by linear filtering. The setup consists of a projection
unit, an acquisition unit and a processing or analysis unit.
The images of the reference plane as well as of the object are captured with
the camera, perpendicular to the surface of the plane or object, and the projector at an
angle in the Image Acquisition step. The captured images contain the projected
patterns on the reference and object surface. 3 phase shifted images are acquired per
surface.

                            The images that are captured include the surface that needs to be tested as well
as certain unwanted elements, such as the background, shadows and reflected light.
Image Processing involves the pre-processing of the captured images to remove the
aforementioned unwanted elements. Background removal is performed to improve
computation time and avoid redundant processing.
Fringe Analysis is the next operation performed on the pre-processed images.
Fringe Analysis consists of 2 steps: (i) phase detection, and (ii) phase unwrapping. In
phase detection, the image is analysed to produce a wrapped phase map distribution.
An inverse tangent function is used to generate phase map from the intensity values of
the captured images. The resultant map contains the localised phase values of the
pixels. The recovered/estimated phase is obtained in the interval [- π, + π]. In general,
true phase may range over an interval greater than 2π. In such cases, phase values
contain artificial discontinuities. The process of determining the unknown integral
multiple of 2π to be added at each pixel of the wrapped phase map to make it
continuous by removing the artificial 2π discontinuities is referred to as phase
unwrapping. Phase unwrapping is an important step with many pre-existing
algorithms designed to perform the task. The unwrapped phase map obtained contains the true phase values at each pixel location.
The phase values are then converted into depth information using Height
Mapping. The dent is detected based on the height map, and then quantified to find
the relative dent depth and area of the dented region. Calibration is needed to perform
accurate image to real world coordinate transformation.<br>
                        Unit testing, Integration testing and system testing are done to see if if all the modules are working fine, individually and when they are integrated with other modules. Testing will also help remove bugs from the software.
After testing all the modules,  GUI was made and the final touches to the software was made. <br><br>

The goal was to study the Bergen swamp preservation society website to be able to identify the usability issues. The main aim of the study was to make sure that the users could clearly  understand and use all the features of the application.<br><br>
                            <p>Purpose:</p>
We were a team of 6 doing the study, and we collaborated with the developer of the new Bergen Swamp Preservation Society website to go about with our usability studies. The main goal was to see if the user experience in the website mapped to the users conceptual model on how to use the website. The purpose was to detect all the usability issues related to the website and also get feedback from all the participants on the website and suggestions on how to improve the website.

                            The Bergen swamp preservation society website had many functionalities in it like, getting directions, calendar, events, photos and so on.<br>
The first step in our usability testing study was to do the heuristic evaluations.
Initially, all of us, individually used the different heuristics and all the gestalt principles to detect the usability flaws in the website. Post this, we merged all of our findings.<br>
	5 students were recruited as participants via flyers. All potential participants had to take the screener questions, and if they were eligible, they were selected to be participants. A 20$ Amazon gift card was given after the study to all the participants. Pilot tests were done initially with 2 participants, Test design was made and a test plan was formulated.<br>
	5 tasks were created and all of them were based on problem scenarios.
These tasks were shuffled between all participants so that there is no transfer of knowledge between tasks and counterbalance the tasks.<br>
The success criteria for each task was predetermined and decided upon by all the team members in advance. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data was done. Qualitative analysis was done by asking the participants questions after every task, quantitative analysis was done by counting the number of clicks and the time taken for every task.
<br>
SUS scale was used to measure the usability of the system

The usability test was done in the usability lab at B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences.  There were two rooms, a testing room and an observation room. There was a one was mirror between them, where only the observers could see the people in the testing room.  The morae software (Morae-observer and Morae-observer) was used to record all the observations of the observers. There was a web camera and microphone to record and listen to the participants.
Based on the input, feedback and suggestions made by the participants, a report was written.
We presented the whole usability study to the client and submitted the report with the recommendations and usability issues present in the website.

                            Accoutre is a mobile application for dressing, that is aimed at providing suggestions and allowing its users to pick out clothes, either (i) based on the current weather outside, or the weather throughout the day, or/and (ii) based on an occasion or an event that they are to attend, such as a party, wedding, interview, sports activity, and so on, scheduled on their calendar or in their emails. The designing of the app was done using adobe photoshop.
Primary stakeholders of our application would be the end users who own and use a smartphone, and ones who need help in picking out clothes based on the current weather outside, or an event they are to attend.

                            <p>Contextual Inquiry:</p>

We conducted contextual inquiries for 12 participants in total. The interviews were conducted via video calls, or in person. We interviewed both male and female participants, between the ages of 20 to 60+ years, and who owned a smartphone. To ensure that the data we collected from our contextual inquiries came from a relatively diverse set of end users, each of our group members interviewed participants who were located at different geographical regions, with varying climates and weather conditions. The interviews also provided us with different scenarios for the type of occasions or events that the participants were most likely to attend or dress for. 

The interviews also provided us with different scenarios for the type of occasions or events that the participants were to attend or dress for. <br>

We gathered important information about the factors influencing the daily routine of picking out clothes for our participants. Most users used a weather application on their smartphones to check the weather, and then proceeded with selecting their clothes. While a few users, mostly college students, picked out their clothes randomly. We also came across a user who took suggestions from their friends and family, to select their outfit for a special occasion or event. The interviews also provided us with different scenarios for the type of occasions or events that the participants were most likely to attend or dress for.

                            <p>Design Ideation and Brainstorming:</p>
From the data collected through our contextual inquiries, we could identify the primary stakeholders of our application, that is, the end users who own and use a smartphone, and ones who need help in picking out clothes based on the current weather outside, or an event they are to attend. 
Based on the information gathered from our study models – flow models, sequence models, artifact models, physical models, and cultural models, we consolidated our findings into an affinity diagram, and a consolidated sequence model. 
In general, our key observations from ‘walking the wall’, with respect to the primary workflows for users to pick out their clothes were as follows: 
<li>Users check the current weather outside or the weather throughout the day, using a reliable weather app, before picking out clothes for that day.</li>
<li>They select clothes based on an occasion or an event, such as a party, wedding, interview, sports activity, and so on.</li>
<li>They pick out clothes randomly.</li>
<li>They use applications such as Instagram or Pinterest to follow fashion trends and be aware.</li>

                            <p>Specific Tasks and App Features:</p>
To narrow down on the design ideas for our application from the users' perspective, we identified the following tasks and features as they relate to the goals:
<li>Sync with the calendar application.</li>
<li> Access to user’s current location.</li>
<li> Access and connect to the weather application.</li>
<li> Sort clothes based on categories, for example – type, fabric or season.</li>
<li> Option to feed-in clothes present in user’s current wardrobe under each category.</li>
<li> Run algorithms to choose and suggest clothes based on weather, events, or fashion trends.</li>
<li> Option to choose and mix-and-match clothes manually, in case the algorithm gets it wrong.</li>
<li> Suggestion to shop for clothes online, based on current requirement and unavailability in user’s closet.</li>
<li> Suggestion of suitable online retailers, and direction to their official websites.</li>

Based on the information gathered, we have generated the various study models, and have consolidated our findings into an affinity diagram, and a consolidated sequence model. We were successful in gathering sufficient information to help us understand users’ patterns of picking out clothes, which would help us tremendously in the next phase of our project.

Each morning, Jenny wakes up and checks the calendar application and e-mail notifications on her phone. She then takes a shower, and randomly picks out clothes to wear to work. Since her office is 10 minutes away from her home, she usually walks to work. One day, on her way to work, it started to pour suddenly. Because Jenny was not prepared for the rain, and did not have a raincoat or an umbrella with her, her clothes and bag got completely drenched.

Ever since Jenny started using the Accoutre app, she wakes up each morning and checks the app, along with other notifications on her phone. She then takes a shower, and wears the clothes suggested by the Accoutre app, based on the current weather outside, and/or an occasion or event she must attend, like a boarding meeting or a party. The app helps her pick out the appropriate outfit each time.

The Aim of the project was to find a system and evaluate its design based on Normans and Gestalt principles (Principles of HCI). We chose Google Maps for this project.<br><br>
                            The first phase over here was field observations and interviews. Each one of us first observed people using Google maps on phones and laptops individually and wrote down our observations. We came back and discussed each one of our observations and then came up with a set of interview questions based on our observations.
<br>Now each of us interviewed participants individually using the interview questions that we had. This was to see how do users interact with the environment in real time and what are the problems they face.

                            The next step was to create User Profiles based using the data we collected from contextual Inquiry. Some characteristics that were decided upon were included and user profiles were created. 
Next, personas were created for each profile present based on our contextual Inquiries and field observations.

The Aim of the project was to find a system and do a heuristic evaluation of the website.
<br>
All of us first discussed to see which website we were going to study and after a lot of discussion, we decided to study, the official website for Virginia’s EZ Pass.
<br>
We all first performed heuristic evaluations individually to identify the usability and accessibility issues in the website.
Once this was done, we all sat and discussed each of our heuristic evaluations and came up with a document which was a compilation of all of the problems we found with the website. A total of 27 usability and accessibility issues was found with the website.

Designed and developed a web application for the course outcome mapping system in R. V. College of Engineering, Bangalore. We used html, css, javascript, html5, jquery, ajax and bootstrap to develop this application. The student portfolio includes marks, attendance, certificates, tuition, grade point averages and other relevant information. The Course Outcome Mapping System performs this batch segregation and assists the counsellors in tracking the performance of students with respect to marks, attendance and extracurricular activities. For instance it helps the faculty/student counsellors calculate the aggregate percentage scored  by a student in an exam/ group of exams in a semester individually and also calculate the class average. This will help faculty see how their students are faring in exams and also assess a class overall. This will also help them make improvements or changes if necessary to their teaching and also their way of setting question papers. The Course Outcome Mapping System also enables the parents to keep track of the performance of their wards and interact with counselors personally using the appointment scheduler included in the portal.                         </div>

                             <p>Introduction:</p>

The most common problem that big amusement parks face today is huge crowds which lead to long wait times and long lines for each ride in the park. The wait times can be so long that it can make the people get so frustrated and not wanting to come back again. This app is designed to bring in a solution to this problem faced by bigger amusement parks.<br><br>
                            <p>Problem:</p>

We all want to spend our leisure time with family and friends especially when we're loaded with work. A theme park is often one of the most favourite places for people to relax, have fun on the rides and forget their troubles for a brief period of time. But isn’t it exhausting to wait in a seemingly never ending queue to get on every single ride? During peak seasons there are queues which could go on up to an hour or even more for every ride. This could be a frustrating problem to a lot of people who have spent a lot of money on the tickets and don’t get to go on all or most of the rides in the park. The whole experience of waiting in a queue for an hour or more for a ride that lasts a few minutes can be stressful, exhausting and demoralizing at times.<br><br>

                            <p>Solution:</p>
A solution for this would be to introduce flash passes or in other words to introduce points for every ride. For instance, let’s say we have one point per ride, and the people have to scan they phone with the barcode for every ride. After two rides, the person can get a fastpass for the next ride, that he has queued up, for which there would be there would be a separate queue where only the people who have accumulated the points and who have that ride queued up for themselves will be able to enter. In this way people would be able to complete most of the rides in an amusement park.
The concept of a flash pass has already been initiated by Disney for their amusement parks, however an application does not exist which makes it very exhausting for the people to walk up to each ride, get a pass for that ride and come back at the time that is mentioned on the pass. However, our objective is to digitize the entire concept so we can develop an app. The application will keep track of all the points accumulated by the park visitors which can be used at any time during the year. The app will also give notification of options on which rides can be accessed without facing the queues.
This solution falls under ‘Market or population characterization for new system concepts’ which will require us to understand the needs of our target users and develop a new in-house system for existing theme parks.<br><br>
<p>Customer:</p>
More businesses in this day and age are reverting to using user data as part of their process strategy. In this particular case, the target user is quite clear – people who visit theme parks multiple times a year. Gaining user data is core towards the successful implementation of our solution.<br><br>
<p>Stakeholders:</p>
There are two key stakeholders that we need to focus on to ensure practical application of the proposed solution – the people who frequent theme parks annually and the businesses who own them. The goal of this process is to ensure that customers who visit theme parks multiple times in a year are given the opportunity to enjoy future visits without the added pressure of waiting in long lines which would encourage them to increase their visits. The businesses will be able to reward their most loyal customers and attract new ones who would then turn into loyal customers which would drastically increase the brand value of company which owns the theme park.<br><br>

The design process included conducting contextual inquiries. We needed to conduct contextual inquiries in order to get the views of all our groups of stakeholders. We designed a list of questions and a screener questionnaire. We then recruited participants. Some of our groups of participants were children, moms, people managing the park and teens. Once we were done with the interviews, we had to analyze and consolidate our data. To do this, we had a brainstorming session where we made our affinity diagram as shown below from the data we had collected from the participants. <br><br>

                            Once this was done, we made user profile personas for all the user profiles present, w.r.t. our scenario. The personas are as shown below. We made both the primary and the secondary personas and also came up with an anti-persona. These are as shown below.

                           Now once we had the personas done, the next step for our team was to build the low-fi prototype. For this, we looked at our affinity diagram and personas to gather in all our data from it. From the data collected, we designed our screen’s content first, post which we drew the low-fi prototypes. The app will include functionalities such as buying daily and seasonal passes, list of rides and with barcodes to scan and storing the rides finished, issuing of fast passes and also designing virtual reality games for people while they are standing in line. The low-fi prototypes are as shown below.

                            This project aims to see how voice assistants affect the academic productivity in RIT students.
<br><br>
<p>Problem:</p>
   The aim of the project was to learn how to perform qualitative, quantitative and experimental research and also write papers. With growing technologies in the world today, there has been a growing market for voice assistants today for a variety of purposes. We wanted to check how this could affect the academic productivity in RIT students and also what are the problems faced especially by international students while using voice assistants. 
<br><br>
                            <p>Research methodology:</p>
We have written two papers till date. One pertaining to  qualitative analysis to see how voice assistants affect the academic productivity of RIT students where we recruited participants,conducted semi-structured interviews and did qualitative analysis based on the results procured form the participants. The second being the quantitative research analysis where we conducted a survey to see how voice assistants affect academic productivity and pose some questions which may particularly prove to be a problem for international students.
We surveyed 37 people and analyzed the collected results post that. The last step was where we wrote two research papers.

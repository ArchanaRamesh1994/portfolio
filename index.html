These long wait times can lead to frustration among the visitors resulting in them never returning to the park again. Coaster Crunch app solves this problem by introducing a digital fast pass system as well as other additional features.</p>

To start redesigning the existing webpages, initially I performed heuristic evaluations on them to identify the usability issues that existed. Considering the existing usability issues, I redesigned these webpages in order to make the website more usable and more visually appealing. Some of the webpages that I designed from scratch were the premium account page and the cancellation page.

                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Process</h1>
I started with redesigning the existing webpages of the website, and then moved on to creating new webpages based on the new design.
I first built the wireframes using Balsamiq for the existing webpages which incorporated the changes necessary to avoid the usability issues identified by the heuristic evaluation. Using the new design layout (which avoided the existing usability issues), I built the wireframes for the new webpages like the premium account page and the cancellation page.
Upon approval of the wireframes by my manager, I started working on building the prototypes for these wireframes using Photoshop and MockPlus.

The present day visual inspection of the aircraft is purely skill based, is time
consuming, raises safety issues to the inspector, and there is also lack of the record of the inspection.
The accuracy can be affected by inspector's boredom level, weather conditions and weariness. Images captured from the aircraft surface and presented to the inspector after enhancing the defects can make the visual inspection easier and accurate which in turn results in saving time, and ensures the safety of aircraft.

Development and implementation of algorithms for the detection of surface
defect (dents) in aircraft surfaces using image processing. It involves image
acquisition, noise removal, background removal, phase wrapping, phase unwrapping
and height mapping.<br><br>

                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Objectives</h1>
The project aims to create a semi-automated system to perform dent detection
on the surface of aircraft structures. The objectives include identification of dented
regions; classification of the dents from surface features such as writings, markings,
textures and patterns; and quantification of the detected dent.

Use of 2D image processing using edge detection is not good enough for the
detection of dents as dents deform the surface into the third dimension. The use of
edge detection will also detect the surface features like writing, markings on the
surface also as defects. This problem can be solved by trying to re-create the height
information of the surface. Variety of ways are described in literature to carry out the
profile mapping using optical profilometry. Fringe pattern based optical profilometry
method is adopted in this study using 3-step Phase Shift which involves following
steps:

Digital Fringe Projection involves projecting a fringe pattern onto the object
surface. A sinusoidal fringe pattern is used as it has features that counter defocussing
and is most apt to be processed by linear filtering. The setup consists of a projection
unit, an acquisition unit and a processing or analysis unit.
The images of the reference plane as well as of the object are captured with
the camera, perpendicular to the surface of the plane or object, and the projector at an
angle in the Image Acquisition step. The captured images contain the projected
patterns on the reference and object surface. 3 phase shifted images are acquired per
surface.

                            The images that are captured include the surface that needs to be tested as well
as certain unwanted elements, such as the background, shadows and reflected light.
Image Processing involves the pre-processing of the captured images to remove the
aforementioned unwanted elements. Background removal is performed to improve
computation time and avoid redundant processing.
Fringe Analysis is the next operation performed on the pre-processed images.
Fringe Analysis consists of 2 steps: (i) phase detection, and (ii) phase unwrapping. In
phase detection, the image is analysed to produce a wrapped phase map distribution.
An inverse tangent function is used to generate phase map from the intensity values of
the captured images. The resultant map contains the localised phase values of the
pixels. The recovered/estimated phase is obtained in the interval [- π, + π]. In general,
true phase may range over an interval greater than 2π. In such cases, phase values
contain artificial discontinuities. The process of determining the unknown integral
multiple of 2π to be added at each pixel of the wrapped phase map to make it
continuous by removing the artificial 2π discontinuities is referred to as phase
unwrapping. Phase unwrapping is an important step with many pre-existing
algorithms designed to perform the task. The unwrapped phase map obtained contains the true phase values at each pixel location.
The phase values are then converted into depth information using Height
Mapping. The dent is detected based on the height map, and then quantified to find
the relative dent depth and area of the dented region. Calibration is needed to perform
accurate image to real world coordinate transformation.<br>
                        Unit testing, Integration testing and system testing were done to see if if all the modules are working correctly, individually and when they are integrated with other modules. Testing will also help remove bugs from the software.
After testing all the modules, user interface was developed and the final touches to the software were made. <br><br>

The purpose was to detect all the usability issues related to the website and also get feedback from all the participants on the website and suggestions on how to improve the website.

                            The Bergen swamp preservation society website had many functionalities in it like getting directions, calendar, events, photos and so on.<br>
The first step in our usability testing study was to perform the heuristic evaluations on the website.
Initially, all of the members in the group, individually used the different heuristics and all the gestalt principles to detect the usability flaws in the website; and we then merged all of our findings.<br>
	We created flyers to recruit 5 students from Rochester Institute of Technology for the study. All potential participants had to take the screener questions, using which we filtered the participants to select the 5 eligible students who visited websites related to nature and nature reserves. A 20$ Amazon gift card was given as a reward after the study to all the participants. Pilot tests were performed initially with 2 participants, using which test design was made and a test plan was formulated.<br>
	5 tasks were created and all of them were based on problem scenarios.
These tasks were shuffled between all participants so that there is no transfer of knowledge between tasks and the tasks were counterbalanced.<br>
The success criteria for each task was predetermined and decided upon by all the team members in advance. Qualitative analysis was performed using the data collected by asking the participants questions after each task, and Quantitative analysis was performed using the data collected by counting the number of clicks and the time taken for every task.
<br>
SUS scale was used to measure the usability of the system.

                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Setup</h1>
The usability tests were performed in the usability lab at B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences. There were two rooms, a testing room and an observation room. There was a one way mirror between them, where only the observers in the observation room could see the people in the testing room.  The morae software (Morae-observer and Morae-observer) was used to record all the observations of the observers. There was a web camera and microphone used to record and listen to the participants.
Based on the input, feedback and suggestions made by the participants; a report was written.
We presented the whole usability study to the client and submitted the report with the recommendations and usability issues present in the website.

                            Accoutre is a mobile application for dressing, that is aimed at providing suggestions and allowing its users to pick out clothes, either 
                            <li>based on the current weather outside, or the weather throughout the day, or/and</li> <li> based on an occasion or an event that they are to attend, such as a party, wedding, interview, sports activity, and so on, scheduled on their calendar or in their emails.</li> All the major designing of the app was done using Adobe Photoshop.

Primary stakeholders of our application would be the end users who own and use a smartphone, and ones who need help in picking out clothes based on the current weather outside, or an event they are to attend. <img class="modalImg align-middle100" src="images/UCD-interview.png"/></div>

                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Contextual Inquiry</h1>

We conducted contextual inquiries for 12 participants in total. The interviews were conducted via video calls, or in person. We interviewed both male and female participants, between the ages of 20 to 60+ years, and who owned a smartphone. To ensure that the data we collected from our contextual inquiries came from a relatively diverse set of end users, each of our group members interviewed participants who were located at different geographical regions, with varying climates and weather conditions. The interviews also provided us with different scenarios for the type of occasions or events that the participants were most likely to attend or dress for. 
<br>

We gathered important information about the factors influencing the daily routine of picking out clothes for our participants. Most users used a weather application on their smartphones to check the weather, and then proceeded with selecting their clothes. While a few users, mostly college students, picked out their clothes randomly. We also came across a user who took suggestions from their friends and family, to select their outfit for a special occasion or event. The interviews also provided us with different scenarios for the type of occasions or events that the participants were most likely to attend or dress for.

From the data collected through our contextual inquiries, we could identify the primary stakeholders of our application, that is, the end users who own and use a smartphone, and ones who need help in picking out clothes based on the current weather outside, or an event they are to attend. 
Based on the information gathered from our study models – flow models, sequence models, artifact models, physical models, and cultural models, we consolidated our findings into an affinity diagram, and a consolidated sequence model. 
In general, our key observations from ‘walking the wall’, with respect to the primary workflows for users to pick out their clothes were as follows: 
<li>Users check the current weather outside or the weather throughout the day, using a reliable weather app, before picking out clothes for that day.</li>
<li>They select clothes based on an occasion or an event, such as a party, wedding, interview, sports activity, and so on.</li>
<li>They pick out clothes randomly.</li>
<li>They use applications such as Instagram or Pinterest to follow fashion trends and be aware.</li>

                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Specific Tasks and App Features</h1>
To narrow down on the design ideas for our application from the users' perspective, we identified the following tasks and features as they relate to the goals:
<li>Sync with the calendar application.</li>
<li> Access to user’s current location.</li>
<li> Access and connect to the weather application.</li>
<li> Sort clothes based on categories, for example – type, fabric or season.</li>
<li> Option to feed-in clothes present in user’s current wardrobe under each category.</li>
<li> Run algorithms to choose and suggest clothes based on weather, events, or fashion trends.</li>
<li> Option to choose and mix-and-match clothes manually, in case the algorithm gets it wrong.</li>
<li> Suggestion to shop for clothes online, based on current requirement and unavailability in user’s closet.</li>
<li> Suggestion of suitable online retailers, and direction to their official websites.</li>

Based on the information gathered, we have generated the various study models, and have consolidated our findings into an affinity diagram, and a consolidated sequence model. We were successful in gathering sufficient information to help us understand users’ patterns of picking out clothes, which would help us tremendously in the next phase of our project.

Each morning, Jenny wakes up and checks the calendar application and e-mail notifications on her phone. She then takes a shower, and randomly picks out clothes to wear to work. Since her office is 10 minutes away from her home, she usually walks to work. One day, on her way to work, it started to pour suddenly. Because Jenny was not prepared for the rain, and did not have a raincoat or an umbrella with her, her clothes and bag got completely drenched.

Ever since Jenny started using the Accoutre app, she wakes up each morning and checks the app, along with other notifications on her phone. She then takes a shower, and wears the clothes suggested by the Accoutre app, based on the current weather outside, and/or an occasion or event she must attend, like a boarding meeting or a party. The app helps her pick out the appropriate outfit each time.

In this study, users using Google maps were observed and problems faced by them related to its user interface were analyzed based on Normans and Gestalt principles (Principles of HCI). The major tasks involved field observations, contextual inquiry, conducting interviews, creating personas, story boarding and heuristic evaluations.<br><br>
                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Process</h1>
                            In the first phase we performed field observations and interviews. Each one of us first observed people using Google maps on phones and laptops individually and noted down our observations. We discussed each one of our observations and then came up with a set of interview questions based on our observations.
<br>In the later stage, each of us interviewed participants individually using the interview questions that we had decided. This interviews were to determine how users interact with the environment in real time and what are the problems they face.

                            The next step was to create User Profiles using the data we collected from the contextual inquiries. Using the characteristics that were decided the user profiles were created. 
Next, personas were created for each profile based on the data acquired from the contextual inquiries and field observations.

                           The final step consisted of the creation of Problem and Design Storyboards.

Both text and graphical representation of storyboards were created.

                        From the analysis performed and the data obtained by interviewing the participants, it can be observed that, some of the common difficulties faced by people while using the Google maps were, 
                        <ol>
<li>To add way points.</li>
<li>To switch Views.</li>
<li>Sharing the route with other people.</li>
                            </ol>
There were also some differences in the way people belonging to older age groups used Google maps as compared to the way the younger generation used Google maps. The younger generation of people were acquianted with Google maps and all its features fairly easily compared to the older generation.

The Aim of the project was to perform heuristic evaluation of the Virginia’s EZ Pass website.
<br>
                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Process</h1>
The initial step was to perform heuristic evaluation on the website, and all the members of the team performed heuristic evaluation individually to identify the usability and accessibility issues in the website.
We then discussed our findings and compiled them into a document which in total had 27 usability and accessibility issues found in the website.

After evaluating the Virginia E-ZPass website, we concluded that it had various usability and accessibility issues that need to be fixed. Although none of the issues we found were considered catastrophic, there were many website issues regarding consistency of terminology and formatting, especially involving menu options, which could lead to confusion for users. Content and information are often displayed in a haphazard way with lengthy text sections and require simplification so that users can comprehend the content easily. The organization and hierarchy of the website is unclear, and  further efforts to organize content in a more user-friendly way, perhaps by detailed task analysis or card sorting, would be beneficial. Although some effort has been made to make this website accessible, including the use of 'alt' tags, a 'skip to main content' link and closed captioning for videos; there is more work that needs to be done to make this site fully accessible, especially to those using screen readers. This website provides a valuable service to the drivers and passengers in Virginia, and should be improved to make E-ZPass tasks easier to accomplish for all users.

Designed and developed a web application for the course 
outcome mapping system for R. V. College of Enginering, Bangalore. The scores obtained by the students for each cource were mapped to its outcomes, which helped in comparing the success rate of a student in fullfiling the course outcomes to the success rates of all other students for each course. 
                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Details</h1>
                            Using web technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, HTML5, JQuery, Ajax and Bootstrap; we developed an application that would map the scores of each student to the outcomes of the courses he/she has taken. The student portfolio includes marks, attendance, certificates, tuition, grade point averages and other relevant information. The Course Outcome Mapping System performs batch segregation and assists the counsellors in tracking the performance of students with respect to marks, attendance and extracurricular activities. For instance it helps the faculty/student counsellors calculate the aggregate percentage scored by a student in an exam/group of exams in a semester individually and also helps in calculating the class average. This will help faculty see how their students are faring in exams and also assess a class overall. This will also help them make improvements or changes if necessary to their teaching style and also their way of setting question papers. The Course Outcome Mapping System also enables the parents to keep track of the performance of their wards and interact with counselors personally using the appointment scheduler included in the portal.                         </div>

                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Introduction:</h1>

The most common problem that big amusement parks face today is the huge crowd which lead to long wait times for the rides in the park. The wait times can be so long that people end up getting frustrated and they wish to never return to such amusement parks. Coaster Crunch app solves this problem by introducing a digital fast pass system as well as other additional features.<br><br>
                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Problem:</h1>

We all want to spend our leisure time with family and friends especially when we're loaded with work. A theme park is often one of the most favourite places for people to relax, have fun on the rides and forget their troubles for a brief period of time. But isn’t it exhausting to wait in a seemingly never ending queue to get on every single ride? During peak seasons there are queues which could go on up to an hour or even more for every ride. This could be a frustrating problem to a lot of people who have spent a lot of money on the tickets and don’t get to go on all or most of the rides in the park. The whole experience of waiting in a queue for an hour or more for a ride that lasts a few minutes can be stressful, exhausting and demoralizing at times.<br><br>

                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Solution:</h1>
A solution for this would be to introduce flash passes or in other words to introduce points for every ride. For instance, let’s say we have one point per ride, and the people have to scan they phone with the barcode for every ride. After two rides, the person can get a fastpass for the next ride, that he has queued up, for which there would be there would be a separate queue where only the people who have accumulated the points and who have that ride queued up for themselves will be able to enter. In this way people would be able to complete most of the rides in an amusement park.
The concept of a flash pass has already been initiated by Disney for their amusement parks, however an application does not exist which makes it very exhausting for the people to walk up to each ride, get a pass for that ride and come back at the time that is mentioned on the pass. However, our objective is to digitize the entire concept so we can develop an app. The application will keep track of all the points accumulated by the park visitors which can be used at any time during the year. The app will also give notification of options on which rides can be accessed without facing the queues.
This solution falls under ‘Market or population characterization for new system concepts’ which will require us to understand the needs of our target users and develop a new in-house system for existing theme parks.<br><br>
<h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Customer:</h1>
More businesses in this day and age are reverting to using user data as part of their process strategy. In this particular case, the target user is quite clear – people who visit theme parks multiple times a year. Gaining user data is core towards the successful implementation of our solution.<br><br>
<h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Stakeholders:</h1>
There are two key stakeholders that we need to focus on to ensure practical application of the proposed solution – the people who frequent theme parks annually and the businesses who own them. The goal of this process is to ensure that customers who visit theme parks multiple times in a year are given the opportunity to enjoy future visits without the added pressure of waiting in long lines which would encourage them to increase their visits. The businesses will be able to reward their most loyal customers and attract new ones who would then turn into loyal customers which would drastically increase the brand value of company which owns the theme park.<br><br>

The design process included conducting contextual inquiries for all the groups of stakeholders to get diverse views. We designed a list of questions and a screener questionnaire, and recruited participants from all groups of stakeholders viz. children, mothers, people managing the park, and teenagers. After conducting the interviews, we analyzed and consolidated our data by brainstorming and making an affinity diagram as shown below. <br><br>

                           After making the personas, the next step was to build the low-fi prototype. Using the affinity diagram we built and the personas, we designed the content for all the screen initially, and then built the low-fi prototypes. The app includes functionalities such as buying daily and seasonal passes, list of rides with barcodes to scan, keeping track of the rides, issuing of fast passes and also designing virtual reality games for people to play while waiting for rides. The low-fi prototypes are as shown below.

                            This project aims at studying how productive are voice assistant applications for academic purposes. Qualitative analysis, Quantitative analysis, and experimental research were performed on the data collected by interviewing students at Rochester Instittue of Technology.
<br><br>
                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Problem:</h1>
   Voice assistants are widely used these days, and has made some of our tasks very easy by providing us the ability to interact with devices over voice. This study was to analyze how productive is the use of voice assistants for academic purposes. In addition, we also analyzed the interaction of non-native English speakers such as lot of the international students with the voice assistants, to determine the problems faced by them. 
<br><br>
                            
                            <h1 class="ModalSubTitle">Results</h1>
                            The qualitative analysis states that  the study cannot definitively confirm whether Voice Assistants improve Rochester Institute of Technology student’s academic productivity. Due to the technological limitations of mobile artificial intelligence, as well as the limited available functionality for academic applications, Voice Assistants cannot yet eclipse the traditional modes that students use to stay productive at school. Although the initial impetus for this research bared insubstantial results, this work has provided a general view of the factors that affect the usage of voice assistants with regards to academic productivity. <br>
In the quantitative study which sought to see impact of Voice Assistants on the academic productivity of international students,  research was going to be done to see whether Voice Assistants limit the everyday production of non-Native English speaking students at Rochester Institute of Technology. Our research concluded that the areas which ultimately impact the productivity of international students at Rochester Institute of Technology is the language they choose to communicate with their Voice Assistants, and not their international status. However, we have found that the majority of Voice Assistant users view accents and general language recognition as the biggest issues of Voice Assistant, regardless of their international status and preferred Voice Assistant language.  Although we expected that different selections of preferred languages would lead to different user experiences, there are no substantial associations between language choices and dissatisfied response times and accuracy, specifically amongst international students at Rochester Institute of Technology.

                            <li>Quantitative analysis</li>
                            We performed Qualitative analysis to determine how voice assistants affect the academic productivity of students at Rochester Institute of Technology. We recruited 10 participants who studied at Rochester Institute of Technology and conducted semi-structured interviews with them. Using the data obtained from the interviews, we performed Qualitative analysis.<br>
                            We performed Quantitative research analysis to determine the problems faced by the non-native English speakers such as lot of the international students at Rochester Institute of Technology while interacting with the voice assistants. For this analysis, we recruited 37 particants who were International students at Rochester Institute of Technology. We conducted a survey with these participants and using the data obtained from the survey, we performed Quantitative analysis.
